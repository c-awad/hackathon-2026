"""Review every MantisGrid API endpoint against the data underneath it.

For each endpoint: call it, record what it returns, and check the claim against
data/prepped/. Writes analysis/out_api_review.json; the write-up is
track-2/API_ANALYSIS.md.

Layer A mirrors the real product. Layer B is proposed, and the brief invites us
to show where its shape is wrong -- so every Layer B verdict here is backed by a
recomputation, not an opinion.
